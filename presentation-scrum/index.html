					<p>
						🔹<b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools
					</p>
					<p>
						🔹<b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation
					</p>
					<p>
						🔹<b>Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation
					</p>
					<p>
						🔹<b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ol>To be agile means to:
						<li>have a self organized team with better interactions and improved communication inside the
							team;</li>
						<li>focus of development to be on creating a working software that delivers business values in
							each iteration;</li>
						<li>have a real customers' collaboration in order to offer them the possibility to provide
							continuous feedback during development;</li>
						<li>be flexible and respond ASAP to scope changes.</li>

					<p>
						The concepts of <b>Scrum</b> and <b>Agile</b> are often confused because
						that <b>Scrum</b> is built around the idea of constant
						improvement, which is
						the main principle of <b>Agile</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Agile is a project management philosophy that utilizes a core set of values or principles
						Scrum is a specific Agile methodology that is used to facilitate a project

				<section>
					<p>
						👩🏼‍💼<b>Product owner</b> - manages and prioritizes features in product backlog. His goal is
						to understand
						business, customer's and market's requirements
					</p>
					<p>
						👨🏻‍💻<b>Development team</b> - is a self-organizing team that includes about 3-9 members which
						goal is
						to deliver a quality product that meets the needs of the users
					</p>

					<h2>Sprint</h2>
					<img src="./assets/sprints.png" alt="Sprints in Agile">
					<p>
						<b>Sprint</b> is a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed
						and made ready for review
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sprint plaining</h2>
					📊📆
					<p>
						<b>Sprint planning</b> is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint.
					</p>
					<p>
						The purpose of <b>sprint planning</b> is to define what can be delivered in the
						sprint and how that work will be achieved.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Sprint planning</b> is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team.
					</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Scrum Artifacts</h2>
					<p>
						<b>Product Backlog</b> – is an always changing, dynamically prioritized list of requirements
						ordered by Business
						Value. Requirements are broken down into User Stories by the Product Owner
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Sprint Backlog</b> - contains all committed User Stories for the current Sprint broken down
						into
						Tasks by the Team. All items on the Sprint Backlog should be developed, tested, documented and
						integrated to fulfill the Team commitment.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						<b>Product increment</b> is the customer deliverables that were produced by completing product
						backlog tasks during a sprint. It also includes the increments of all previous sprints.
					</p>
					<img src="./assets/artifacts.png" alt="Scrum artifacts">
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Extended artifacts</h4>
					<p>
						🟡<b>Burndown Chart</b> - used to communicate and track progress toward the sprint goal during
						the sprint. Burndown charts are graphs that display tasks completed over the duration of a
						sprint
					</p>

					<p>
						🟡<b>The definition of “done”</b> - helps define the boundaries of an increment.

					<h2>User Story</h2>
					<p>
						A <b>user story</b> is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the
						perspective
						of the end user or customer.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <b>purpose</b> of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a
						particular value
						back to the customer.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<h4>User stories serve a number of key benefits:</h4>
						<li>Stories keep the focus on the user</li>
						<li>Stories enable collaboration</li>
						<li>Stories drive creative solutions</li>
						<li>Stories create momentum</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						User stories are often expressed in a simple sentence, structured as follows:
					</p>
					<cite>
						<b><i>“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”</i></b>
					</cite>

					<h2>Estimation</h2>

					<h3>Planning Poker</h3>
					<img width="65%" src="./assets/poker.png" alt="Poker">
					<p>
						Planning Poker is an agile estimating and planning technique that is consensus based.
						Each estimator is holding a deck of Planning Poker cards with possible values (Fibonacci
						numbers). The values represent
						the number of story points, ideal days, or other units.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>🔺Story Points🔺</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Story Points</b> - are relative values, a story that is estimated with 2 story points should
						be twice as much as items that are estimated with 1 story point
					</p>
					<p>
						Story points represent the
						effort to develop a story and this includes everything that can affect the effort including
						amount, complexity and risks associated with this work
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul><b>Each User Story</b> must:
						<li>be created by using the above template;</li>
						<li>respect INVEST rule;</li>
						<li>have a set of acceptance criteria;</li>
						<li>be estimated by the team in Story Points by using Playing Poker technique.</li>
